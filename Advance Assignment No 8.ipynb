    "Ans.  These exceptions are defined by exception classes, from which an exception object can be created when an exception is raised (if a handler uses the addition INTO in CATCH). A class-based exception can either cancel the current context or allow for a resume. Exceptions are raised using the statement RAISE EXCEPTION and handled using CATCH in a TRY control structure. Class-based exceptions can be raised in any procedures and can be further propagated by any procedures."
